# Udacity-Android-Project-3A-Alexandria
This is project 4 of 9 in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program. 

The mandates of this project is to add features to an existing project. 

The requires features to add include 1) a scanning functinality that doesn't require the installation of other apps and 2) preventing the app from crashing when no internet connection is available. 

I used the Zxing library (http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android-sdk-create-a-barcode-reader--mobile-17162) to fulfill mandate #1. 

And I created a function that checks for the availability of network connection before a network request is made to fulfill mandate #2.
